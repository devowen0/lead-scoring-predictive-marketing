Hi [First Name],

Ever wonder why nearly every store has a “big sale” right before a new season starts?
It’s not just about clearing shelves — it’s about strategy.

Here’s why seasonal sales are so powerful:

🍂 They match how we shop.
When the weather changes, so do our habits. We need different clothes, tools, and even food. Sales simply meet us where we already are.

📦 They move inventory efficiently.
Retailers use seasonal sales to make room for new arrivals. That’s why you’ll often find the best deals right when you’re ready for something new.

🧠 They create urgency.
A limited-time offer encourages us to decide faster — which is why you’ll often see “48-hour flash sale!” emails near the end of a season.

Interestingly, research shows that many people now plan their big purchases around seasonal sales, turning them into mini-events (think “Black Friday” but year-round).

So next time you see a seasonal promotion, you’ll know — it’s not random, it’s a well-timed strategy to benefit both shoppers and stores.

What’s one seasonal item you always wait to grab on sale?

Until next time,
